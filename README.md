# Kaabo - Property Rental Platform

**Built by Joseph Onipede** | 🚧 **In Development** | 🌟 **Open Source**

Kaabo is a property rental app I'm building to solve a real problem in Nigeria. For too long, agents have been extorting Nigerians with outrageous fees and unnecessary middleman costs. We're here to stop that by connecting landlords directly with tenants - no agents, no exploitation, just fair housing.

**🤝 Want to help?** This project is open source and I welcome contributors who share the vision of making housing accessible for all Nigerians.

## 🎯 **Our Mission**

**Stop Agent Exploitation** - Nigerian agents have been charging ridiculous fees (sometimes 2-3 years rent upfront!) and providing little value. We're cutting them out completely.

## 🚀 **What Makes It Special**

- **Zero Agent Fees** - Direct landlord-tenant communication saves everyone money
- **Real Nigerian Experience** - Built specifically for Nigerian users with local languages
- **Student-Focused** - Find apartments near your campus with distance filtering
- **Smart Notifications** - Get alerts when properties near your campus are posted
- **Real-Time Updates** - Everything syncs instantly across all devices
- **Complete Management** - Landlords can manage tenants, payments, and analytics

## 🛠️ **How I Built It**

**Architecture**: Clean Architecture with proper separation of concerns

**Tech Stack**:
- Flutter 3.7+ for cross-platform mobile
- Riverpod for state management with real-time updates
- Firebase for backend (Auth, Firestore, Storage, Messaging)
- Google Maps for location features
- Custom localization for Nigerian languages

## 💡 **Key Features**

**For Students & Renters**:
- Find apartments within walking distance of your campus
- Browse in your preferred Nigerian language
- Get instant notifications for new listings
- Rate and review properties and landlords
- Chat directly with property owners

**For Landlords**:
- Manage multiple properties and tenants
- Track rent payments and send reminders
- View analytics and financial reports
- Screen potential tenants
- Get matched with pre-qualified renters

## 🎯 **What I'm Proud Of**

**Smart Location Features**:
- Automatically detects how far properties are from major Nigerian universities
- Shows "5 minutes walk to UI" or "10 minutes to UNILAG"
- Sends location-based alerts like "New 2-bedroom near your campus"

**Real Nigerian Experience**:
- Full support for Pidgin, Hausa, Yoruba, and Igbo
- Naira currency formatting
- Understanding of Nigerian rental culture

**Instant Everything**:
- Real-time updates when properties are posted, updated, or deleted
- Live chat between landlords and tenants
- Instant payment notifications

## 📱 **Language Support**

The app speaks your language:
- **English**: "Find Your Perfect Home"
- **Pidgin**: "Find Your Perfect House" 
- **Hausa**: "Nemo Gidan Da Ya Dace Da Ku"
- **Yoruba**: "Wa Ile Ti O Ye Fun E"
- **Igbo**: "Chọta Ụlọ Kwesịrị Gị"

## 🔧 **Technical Highlights**

- **Real-time State Management**: Everything updates instantly across the app
- **Clean Architecture**: Scalable, maintainable code structure
- **Firebase Integration**: Authentication, database, storage, and messaging
- **Geolocation**: Campus proximity detection and mapping
- **Multi-language**: Custom localization system for Nigerian languages
- **Performance**: Optimized for smooth user experience

## 📈 **Built to Scale**

- Real-time updates without performance hits
- Optimized Firebase queries for fast loading
